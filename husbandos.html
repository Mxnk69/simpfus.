        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p> Gojo is easily recognizable by his tall, athletic build, white hair, and striking blue eyes, which are often
          covered by a blindfold or dark sunglasses due to his powerful Six Eyes technique. His usual attire is a
          high-collar black jacket and pants, emphasizing his sleek, confident style.

          <br>
          Satoru Gojo is confident, eccentric, and often playful. Despite his power, he has a laid-back and friendly
          demeanor with his students, although he can be blunt and even arrogant with enemies and fellow jujutsu
          sorcerers. He cares deeply for his students and has a strong belief in protecting the younger generation of
          sorcerers. Although he doesn’t take many things seriously, Gojo has a clear sense of justice and is fiercely
          determined to change the corrupt structures of the Jujutsu world.<br>
          Gojo hails from the prestigious Gojo family, a powerful lineage known for producing strong jujutsu sorcerers.
          As the first person in centuries to inherit both the Six Eyes and Limitless technique, he was recognized as a
          prodigy from a young age. His upbringing in the elite sorcerer world gave him a unique perspective on the
          jujutsu hierarchy, and he now seeks to reform this system, prioritizing protecting students and the next
          generation of sorcerers over established traditions.<br>Gojo plays a crucial role in Jujutsu Kaisen as both a
          mentor and protector. He serves as a teacher at Tokyo Jujutsu High and trains his students, especially Yuji
          Itadori, Megumi Fushiguro, and Nobara Kugisaki, to become stronger sorcerers. His goal is to reshape the
          sorcery world, aiming to make it safer and less restrictive. Gojo's charisma, unmatched power, and dedication
          to his ideals make him a standout character and a fan favorite in Jujutsu Kaisen.

        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p> Kiyotaka has a slender yet athletic build, with short, slightly disheveled brown hair and calm, brown eyes.
          He generally wears the standard school uniform, and his expressions often remain neutral, making him seem
          unapproachable or aloof.<br>
          Kiyotaka is highly reserved, observant, and strategic, often maintaining a low profile to avoid attracting
          unnecessary attention. He avoids forming close bonds with others, preferring a calm, emotionless demeanor that
          makes him seem indifferent. However, beneath this exterior lies a cunning and analytical mind, and Kiyotaka is
          willing to manipulate situations to achieve his goals. He possesses a deep understanding of psychology and
          human behavior, which he uses to navigate the challenges he faces in school.<br>Kiyotaka grew up in the White
          Room, a highly secretive and intense training facility designed to create exceptional individuals by isolating
          them from normal emotional experiences. This upbringing left him emotionally detached and highly suspicious of
          others’ intentions. His father, the founder of the White Room, wanted Kiyotaka to embody perfection, but
          Kiyotaka eventually distanced himself from this expectation. When he entered Advanced Nurturing High School,
          he intended to live a quiet, low-profile life, free from his father’s influence, but the school’s highly
          competitive structure soon pulled him into complex social dynamics.<br>Kiyotaka is initially placed in Class
          1-D, the lowest-ranked class, but he begins subtly influencing events around him to elevate the class’s
          status. His strategic mind and influence become increasingly crucial as his classmates compete to reach the
          top. He works from behind the scenes to help his class without revealing his true potential, developing
          complex relationships with classmates like Suzune Horikita and Kei Karuizawa. His journey in the series
          reveals his internal struggles, his detachment from ordinary life, and his efforts to balance his hidden
          talents with his desire for normalcy.<br></p>

        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p> Grimmjow has a tall, lean build, with striking blue hair and fierce blue eyes. He has a Hollow fragment in
          the form of a jawbone on his right cheek and a distinctive “6” tattoo on his back, denoting his rank among the
          Espada. His attire usually consists of the standard white Espada uniform with a high collar and a distinct,
          untamed style that reflects his wild personality.<br>
          Grimmjow is known for his rebellious, aggressive, and proud nature. He has a deeply competitive streak and
          craves battle, often seeking out powerful opponents. Despite his seemingly chaotic personality, he has a
          strong sense of honor in combat and despises those who avoid direct confrontation. Grimmjow's disdain for
          authority is clear as he frequently challenges orders from other Espada and Aizen himself. He holds a personal
          rivalry with Ichigo Kurosaki and is determined to prove his strength.<br>
          Nazuna meets the protagonist, Ko Yamori, who is struggling with insomnia and a sense of
          purposelessness in his
          Grimmjow was a Hollow who transformed into a powerful Adjuchas-class Menos. Originally leading a group of
          Hollows in Hueco Mundo, he devoured his companions to grow stronger and ultimately achieved Arrancar form
          through Aizen's intervention. His unyielding desire to fight and survive led him to accept Aizen's offer to
          become an Espada, though he remains skeptical of authority and focuses on his own path to strength.<br>
          Grimmjow plays a significant role in the Arrancar Arc, where he engages in multiple battles with Ichigo. His
          rivalry with Ichigo drives him to pursue ever-stronger forms of power, leading to their intense, highly
          memorable clashes. Despite his role as an antagonist, Grimmjow's code of honor and his straightforward,
          unfiltered personality make him a complex character who gains respect even from his enemies. His dynamic and
          ever-evolving rivalry with Ichigo is one of the highlights of Bleach, making him one of the series' most
          iconic characters.<br>

        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p> Ichigo is a tall, muscular young man with orange hair and brown eyes, often seen wearing his high school
          uniform or casual clothes. As a Soul Reaper, he wears the traditional black shihakushō robe, which later gains
          a unique design in his evolved forms. His hair color makes him stand out, often leading to misunderstandings
          and fights due to people assuming he’s a delinquent. <br>
          Ichigo is serious, determined, and protective, with a strong sense of justice. He has a natural empathy for
          others and is deeply loyal to his friends and family, going to great lengths to protect them. Despite his
          often serious demeanor, he has a sarcastic, blunt sense of humor and often reacts with impatience or
          irritation in confusing situations. Ichigo's inner strength comes from his desire to help others, and his
          sense of duty propels him forward even when faced with overwhelming challenges.<br>
          Ichigo grew up in Karakura Town with his father, Isshin, and his two younger sisters, Yuzu and Karin. His
          mother, Masaki, was tragically killed by a Hollow when he was young, a trauma that motivated his desire to
          protect his loved ones. After unexpectedly receiving Soul Reaper powers from Rukia Kuchiki, Ichigo began a
          journey to understand his powers and role in the spirit world. Over time, he discovered his mixed heritage as
          a Soul Reaper, Quincy, and Hollow, which contributes to his unique spiritual abilities.<br>
          As the main protagonist, Ichigo's journey encompasses numerous arcs, from his initial role as a Substitute
          Soul Reaper to his battles with Aizen, the Arrancar, the Fullbringers, and the Quincy army. His character
          development is closely tied to his struggles with identity and power, and his relationships with allies like
          Rukia, Orihime, and his other friends are central to his story. He confronts various challenges that push him
          to grow stronger, making him both a protector and a bridge between the human and spirit worlds.<br></p>

          served as the Captain of the 5th Division. For centuries, he acted as a kind and supportive leader, concealing
          his true ambitions and experiments with the Hōgyoku. Behind the scenes, he meticulously planned to overthrow
          the Soul Society, using Rukia Kuchiki, the Arrancar, and his fellow Soul Reapers to further his plans. His
          ultimate goal was to overthrow the Soul King, seeing the spirit world's ruling system as flawed. <br>

          suicide. Despite this, he cares deeply for his friends and takes his role in the Armed Detective Agency

          Mafia adds to his complex past, as he was known for his strategic brilliance and significant influence within
          the criminal organization. At some point, he began to question his purpose and moral beliefs, leading him to
          leave the Mafia and join the Armed Detective Agency, where he began working for the greater good.<br> Dazai’s
          blend of intelligence, humor, and tragedy, combined with his mysterious past and strong sense of purpose, make

          between the morally gray worlds of the Armed Detective Agency and the Port Mafia, embodying the series’
          exploration of justice, redemption, and identity.<br> </p>

        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
          Geto has long black hair, which he often ties back in a bun, and a calm, charismatic presence. His usual
          attire consists of dark robes with a slightly traditional aesthetic, reinforcing his alignment with
          traditional jujutsu beliefs. His prominent scar across his forehead is a defining feature, marking a
          significant point in his storyline.


          Geto is highly intelligent, eloquent, and principled, with a strong sense of conviction about the role of
          sorcerers in society. Originally a compassionate sorcerer who believed in protecting non-sorcerers, he
          gradually became disillusioned by humanity’s flaws and began to view non-sorcerers as a threat to sorcerers.
          He is often calm and collected, even in battle, and possesses a magnetic charisma that enables him to gather
          followers who share his ideals. However, his descent into extremist beliefs also unveils his darker, more
          ruthless side, as he begins to see eradicating non-sorcerers as the solution to his perceived problems.


          Geto is one of the most powerful jujutsu sorcerers of his time, known for his mastery over Curse Manipulation:

          Curse Manipulation: Geto’s innate technique allows him to absorb and control cursed spirits, making him a
          formidable force in battle, as he can deploy a variety of curses depending on the situation.
          Skilled Combatant: Geto is highly skilled in hand-to-hand combat and tactics, often using his wits to
          outmaneuver opponents.
          Intellectual and Strategic Mind: Geto is not only a powerful sorcerer but also a strategic thinker. His
          charismatic leadership allows him to gather followers who align with his anti-non-sorcerer ideology.
          Background
          Geto was once a student at Tokyo Jujutsu High, where he was close friends with Satoru Gojo. Together, they
          were viewed as two of the most promising young sorcerers of their time. However, after a traumatic mission
          involving curses and non-sorcerers, Geto began questioning the value of protecting those who cannot see or
          understand the sorcery world. This event led to his growing resentment of non-sorcerers and eventual break
          from the Jujutsu world’s accepted beliefs. He ultimately left the Jujutsu Society, branding himself as a rogue
          sorcerer.


          Geto becomes a significant antagonist in Jujutsu Kaisen 0 and the main series, where he acts as a shadowy
          figure instigating conflict between sorcerers and cursed spirits. His actions catalyze several major events,
          and his rivalry with Gojo, whom he once deeply respected, adds emotional depth to his storyline. His ideology,
          charisma, and tragic downfall as a former hero-turned-antagonist make Geto a complex and enduring figure in
          the series.

        <h3>Appears In</h3>
        <p> Berserk</p>

      </div>



      <div class="description">
        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Guts is tall, muscular, and rugged with a heavily scarred body, reflecting his brutal past and constant
          battles. He has short, spiky black hair, one eye (having lost the other in a traumatic event), and a
          prosthetic left arm with a built-in cannon. His typical attire is dark and practical, designed for combat, and
          he carries his massive weapon, the Dragon Slayer, which is a sword as long as he is tall.


          Guts is driven, resilient, and battle-hardened, embodying an intense will to survive despite overwhelming
          odds. His life has been shaped by constant violence, but beneath his tough exterior lies a vulnerable soul
          marked by suffering, loss, and loneliness. Guts initially has a solitary mindset, believing strength and
          self-reliance are his only ways to endure the harshness of life. However, his relationships, especially with
          Casca and the Band of the Hawk, reveal a softer side, showing he is capable of deep loyalty and love. After
          his betrayal by Griffith, Guts is consumed by revenge but gradually learns to balance his vengeance with his
          desire to protect those he cares about.


          Guts is one of the most skilled fighters in the Berserk universe, displaying exceptional strength, speed, and
          combat prowess:

          Swordsmanship: Guts wields the Dragon Slayer, a massive sword that most people could barely lift, with ease
          and skill. His strength and endurance are almost inhuman, allowing him to take on monstrous foes.
          Berserker Armor: This mystical armor enhances Guts’ strength and senses, allowing him to fight far beyond
          normal limits but at the cost of severe strain on his body and mind, often driving him to near madness.
          Survival Skills: Due to his harsh life, Guts is adept at surviving in any situation, from wilderness survival
          to taking on large groups of enemies alone.
          Prosthetic Arm with Cannon and Crossbow: Guts’ prosthetic arm has built-in weapons, making it both versatile
          and deadly in close-range combat.
          Background
          Guts’ origins are tragic: he was born from the corpse of his hanged mother and raised by mercenaries. His
          harsh upbringing under Gambino, a mercenary leader, shaped his early life, filled with pain and survival.
          After joining the Band of the Hawk, he found camaraderie and even love, particularly with Griffith, the
          ambitious leader of the group, and Casca, the group's second-in-command. However, Griffith's ultimate betrayal
          and the Eclipse event shattered Guts' life, as he lost nearly all of his comrades and witnessed horrific acts,
          including Casca's assault by Griffith. The event marked him as a branded "sacrifice," forever cursed to be
          pursued by demons.

          Afterward, Guts took on the role of "The Black Swordsman," seeking revenge on Griffith while enduring
          relentless attacks by supernatural forces. Over time, he gathered new allies, including characters like Puck,
          Farnese, and Serpico, and began to find a purpose beyond revenge as he sought to protect those he loved,
          especially Casca.


          Guts’ journey is central to Berserk, exploring his struggles with revenge, survival, and the quest for a
          meaningful life amidst chaos. His story is one of transformation: while he begins as a vengeance-driven
          warrior, he gradually becomes a protector, balancing his brutal nature with compassion. His battles with the
          Apostles, Griffith, and his own inner demons are symbolic of the broader themes in Berserk of human resilience
          and the search for identity and freedom.

          Guts’ complex journey, filled with pain, determination, and fleeting moments of happiness, makes him one of
          the most iconic and multi-dimensional characters in manga and anime. His story is a harrowing but inspiring
          tale of struggle and survival, capturing the enduring fight against overwhelming darkness.

      <div class="description">
        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p> Yuta is a tall, slender young man with black hair and a somewhat melancholic expression. His simple
          attire—typically a white shirt and dark pants—matches his reserved, introspective personality. He often
          appears quiet and thoughtful, carrying an aura of mystery and subdued sadness, especially due to his
          connection to Rika Orimoto, a spirit bound to him.


          Initially, Yuta is shy, introverted, and emotionally burdened by his past, especially by the curse of his
          childhood friend Rika. However, over time, he grows in confidence and strength, developing a powerful resolve
          to protect others and prevent tragedies similar to his own. Yuta is empathetic and compassionate, with a deep
          sense of responsibility for his powers. Despite the sorrow he carries, he genuinely cares for those around
          him, especially his friends and allies in the jujutsu world. His growth from a hesitant, haunted young man
          into a determined and powerful sorcerer is a central part of his journey.


          Yuta is one of the most powerful sorcerers in the series, known for his versatile abilities and mastery over
          cursed energy:

          Rika’s Curse: Initially, Yuta was bound to the powerful spirit of Rika Orimoto, his deceased childhood friend,
          who was cursed after her untimely death. Rika’s immense power manifests as a guardian spirit that can unleash
          devastating force in battle, amplifying Yuta's abilities significantly.
          Exceptional Cursed Energy: Yuta has an unusually high amount of cursed energy, which makes him capable of
          sustaining and utilizing powerful techniques, including healing others.
          Copying Techniques: Yuta can mimic the cursed techniques of other sorcerers, a rare ability that makes him
          extremely versatile and unpredictable.
          Swordsmanship: Yuta is proficient in close combat and often uses a katana, combining it with his cursed energy
          for precise and lethal strikes.
          Background
          Yuta's story begins with the tragic death of his childhood friend Rika Orimoto, who became a powerful curse
          attached to him after her death. Terrified and unable to control Rika's power, Yuta initially lives in
          isolation, struggling to understand and cope with the curse. His journey changes when he is taken under the
          mentorship of Satoru Gojo, who brings him to Jujutsu High. There, Yuta learns to control his abilities and
          discovers his natural talent for jujutsu.

          Over time, Yuta grows close to his classmates, including Maki Zenin, Toge Inumaki, and Panda, finding
          companionship and support. His journey culminates in Jujutsu Kaisen 0, where he confronts Rika’s curse and
          ultimately learns the truth about her attachment to him, freeing her spirit.


          Yuta plays a central role in Jujutsu Kaisen 0 as the protagonist, where his journey revolves around
          understanding and mastering his cursed abilities while learning the value of his friendships. After this
          prequel arc, he continues to appear in the main series as one of the strongest young sorcerers, committed to
          protecting the jujutsu world. His experience with Rika gives him a deep understanding of cursed spirits, and
          he serves as a valuable ally in battles against powerful enemies.

          Yuta’s story is one of self-discovery, overcoming trauma, and finding purpose. His growth from a sorrowful,
          isolated boy into a courageous protector exemplifies Jujutsu Kaisen's themes of resilience, connection, and
          the complexities of living with supernatural abilities. His abilities and compassionate nature make him a
          beloved character in the series.

      <div class="description">
        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>In his current form, Sukuna manifests within Yuji Itadori’s body, and he appears as a tattooed version of
          Yuji with distinctive marks on his face, symbolizing his cursed nature. In ancient depictions, Sukuna was said
          to have had two faces and four arms, representing his monstrous and powerful nature. Sukuna’s expressions
          often carry a sense of arrogance, cruelty, and cunning, reflective of his boundless confidence and disdain for
          others.

          Sukuna is ruthless, sadistic, and highly confident, seeing both sorcerers and curses as beneath him. He revels
          in destruction, chaos, and violence, treating human life as inconsequential. Despite his cruel nature, Sukuna
          is highly intelligent and calculative, often showing an unsettling level of patience and cunning in his plans.
          His relationship with Yuji, whom he inhabits, is antagonistic yet complex, as he manipulates and tests Yuji
          while secretly pursuing his own mysterious goals. Sukuna’s pride and ego make him an intimidating figure, as
          he views most challenges with disdain, showing interest only when faced with particularly strong opponents or
          unique circumstances.


          Sukuna is one of the strongest cursed beings in the series, possessing numerous formidable abilities:

          Vast Cursed Energy: Sukuna has immense reserves of cursed energy, far exceeding most other cursed spirits and
          sorcerers. His aura alone can induce fear and dread in even experienced sorcerers.
          Innate Techniques: Sukuna has several cursed techniques, though his full abilities are still unfolding. His
          known techniques include the Dismantle and Cleave attacks, which allow him to slice through anything in his
          path with precision.
          Domain Expansion - Malevolent Shrine: Sukuna’s domain, the Malevolent Shrine, is a powerful and deadly
          technique that traps his opponent within a vast, shrine-like area where he can precisely target and dismantle
          anything within range.
          Regeneration and Healing: Due to his curse energy, Sukuna can heal injuries, even those inflicted on others,
          making him nearly impossible to kill or permanently harm.
          Binding Vows: Sukuna forms Binding Vows with Yuji to create deals or limits that benefit him, allowing him to
          exert control over Yuji’s body for brief periods.
          Background
          Sukuna was an ancient sorcerer from over a thousand years ago, renowned as one of the strongest and most
          feared figures in jujutsu history. Due to his cruelty and strength, he was worshipped and feared as the "King
          of Curses." After his death, his power was so immense that his body could not be fully destroyed, resulting in
          his curse being preserved across twenty of his fingers, each one harboring a portion of his power. These
          fingers became powerful cursed objects scattered throughout the world, feared by sorcerers and sought after by
          curses.

          Sukuna’s power and reputation have endured through the ages, and he is regarded as a mythical being of
          unparalleled strength, feared even in the present. When Yuji Itadori consumes one of Sukuna’s fingers, Sukuna
          is resurrected in part, gaining a second life through Yuji and becoming a threat to both sorcerers and curses
          alike.


          Sukuna’s presence within Yuji introduces a unique internal struggle, as he embodies the darkness and
          corruption that Yuji must resist. His relationship with Yuji is symbiotic yet volatile, as Sukuna often takes
          advantage of situations to further his own interests, frequently testing Yuji’s resolve. Sukuna's goals are
          largely unknown, though he shows a consistent interest in chaos and an enigmatic curiosity toward certain
          individuals, such as Satoru Gojo and Megumi Fushiguro.

          Sukuna’s character serves as a representation of humanity’s darker desires and the allure of power, bringing
          complex moral and existential themes into Jujutsu Kaisen. His monstrous strength, cunning nature, and
          unpredictable goals make him an embodiment of fear and tension in the series, serving as both an antagonist
          and a catalyst for Yuji’s development.
